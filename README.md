### JavaScript Game - Read Me

This is a cool two player math game created using JavaScript. I made this in Week 2 at Lighthouse Labs. 

Player 1 is prompted with a simple math problem using "+", "-", or "x" with any two numbers between 1 and 20. After Player 1 answers (correctly or not) then it's Player 2's turn. The game continues until someone answers incorrectly three times. Then the game announces the winner. 

Very cool!
